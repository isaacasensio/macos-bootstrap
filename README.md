## Repo overview

This repo is where I keep track of all the macOS applications and tools I use.

I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as a package manager to easilly install all the required software.

For any additional customization, please check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/isaacasensio/dotfiles) repo.
